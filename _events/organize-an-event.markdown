## Here are some tips:

* Decide on a date, time, duration and location


* Provide a title and a description.


* Optionally: create a signup with [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) or [The Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) or whatever tool you like


* Add the events to the calendar by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceZqvFrTjQSVDc-NH12WPMV0vHF853zF3NPtmIQCNzIHcqjw/viewform).


* Post about it on Facebook as often as you like to promote it - the more often the better!


* Send an email to our [The Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) group

If you need to update the entry in the calendar email [Joris](mailto:Joris@indivisibleacton.org)
