To organize an event we wish to reach people in as many ways as possible.

### Basic Organization of your ACTION
* Decide on a date, time, duration and location

* Provide a title and a description.

* Optional: If you wish people to sign up: create a signup with [The Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) -preferred- OR [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) whatever tool you like.

### Facebook

  -) Post the event on the group's *public* page [https://www.facebook.com/IndivisibleActon/](https://www.facebook.com/IndivisibleActon/)

  -) Copy the link from the top browser bar.

  -) Share the post to the group's *private* page
[https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndivisibleActon/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndivisibleActon/)

  -) Ask to share the post to other groups by emailing [jeanie@indivisibleacton.org](mailto:jeanie@indivisibleacton.org) 

### Website

* Add the events to the group's calendar by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceZqvFrTjQSVDc-NH12WPMV0vHF853zF3NPtmIQCNzIHcqjw/viewform).

* The form will ask to include *the link* to your Facebook post or Action Network event. In that way, people can click on the link in the calendar entry for up to date information.

* If you are planning a series of actions, ask for website entry, by posting in the #ia_website channel on Slack.

### Newsletter

Preferred: add a blurb the #ia_newsletter channel on IA Slack. Include *the link* above.
