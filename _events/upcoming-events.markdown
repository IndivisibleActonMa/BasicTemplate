## Some Events to Consider

### Tuesday, Jul 2

* **7-9p**, Concord:  ***Postcarding for Dan McReady*** - Caffè  Nero, Concord, MA.  Click [HERE](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/2019/06/17/postcarding.html) for more info.

### Tuesday, Jul 9

* **10a**, Boston: ***Hearing for [H.471](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H471) an act relative to science curriculum standards*** - This bill requires that science taught in Massachusetts public schools include only peer-reviewed scientific subject matter. This is a way of making sure that climate change is not denied, nor is evolution. Our children deserve the best education that they can get, rather than the ridiculous “alternatives” being taught in other states. Please call or write the Chairs of the Joint Committee on Education, Representative Alice Peisch Alice.Peisch@mahouse.gov (617-722-1206) and Senator Jason Lewis Jason.Lewis@masenate.gov (617-722-2070) before July 9. Come to the meeting if you can!  MA State House, A-2, Boston, MA.  


* **7-9p**, Concord:  ***Postcarding for Dan McReady*** - Caffè  Nero, Concord, MA.  Click [HERE](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/2019/06/17/postcarding.html) for more info.


* **7-9p**, Acton: ***Join Mothers Out Front in Acton for a showing of Paris to Pittsburgh*** at the South Acton Congregational Church. The climate crisis is a huge problem, but we can all be part of the solution. As the weather grows more deadly and destructive, Americans from coastal cities to America’s heartland aren’t waiting for Washington, DC to act. Hear the stories of communities stepping up to address climate change and fighting for a livable future. [Watch the trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFznn8FNRbU). Looking forward to seeing you at this event!

### Friday, Jul 12

* **6-8p**, Westford: ***Lights for Liberty - A Vigil to End Human Detention Camps*** - Attend this Lights for Liberty event to support an end to human detention camps and learn more about ways you can support the human rights of immigrants, children and adults being held in inhumane conditions at detention centers across the country. At 8pm a candle lit moment of silence will honor those who are suffering in detention and families who have been separated by current immigration policies. At 9pm you may light a candle in your window at home to join thousands across the nation. See [www.lightsforliberty.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.lightsforliberty.org&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2FKHKENuA7gh5t8CRZyEdq) to learn about or host an event near you. . #lights4liberty #dontlookaway #endusconcentrationcamps
