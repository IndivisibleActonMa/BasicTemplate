* Take the [Indivisible Unity Pledge](http://pledge.indivisible.org): The pledge is that no matter our differences in the primary, once Democrats have a nominee, we’ll do everything in our power to get the nominee elected.  Click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HojK7c7X3WE&link_id=18&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e&source=email-2019-5-7-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter&email_referrer=email_540613&email_subject=2019-5-7-indivisible-acton-weekly-newsletter) to watch a clip about the Pledge on Rachel Maddow.


* Call your Members of Congress and explain that you object to imposing asylum application fees on people fleeing persecution and danger. Not only is this amoral and inhumane, the American Immigration Lawyers Association says the president’s plan “contradicts international law” and still “fails to ensure orderly processing.” Ask your MOCs are doing to stop the president’s asylum fee and instead heal the root causes of life-threatening conditions in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador? (H/T Americans of Conscience Checklist).

* **Immigration - Child Separation**:   Over 2,000 migrant children, many of whom were separated from parents or other relatives, are being housed in a detention facility in Homestead, Florida.  Because the facility is considered a privately run “emergency influx facility,” the government is arguing that it is not subject to the provisions in the Flores Act, and as a result, children there are incarcerated for an average of 58 days (the Flores Act limit is 20 days) before being released to a sponsor. Part of the problem is that sponsors who are undocumented are being detained and deported, leaving the children without a place to go. This private for-profit facility is costing taxpayers $750/day, compared to $250/day it costs to detain individuals in government-run facilities. [https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/why-its-time-to-shut-down-homestead-detention-center](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/why-its-time-to-shut-down-homestead-detention-center). The American Friends Service Committee has been working with other interfaith groups to provide a consistent witness presence at the site, an a [larger action](https://migrantjustice.afsc.org/) is being planned in Homestead for Father’s Day, June 16.  We can help by [donating money](https://www.gofundme.com/witness-tornillo-homestead?fbclid=IwAR18JFq_n9Xa16N6REQqsYk6o6sfI3rooJorD8-xeYgCjeOhNcDb20j5ev0), and telling our MoCs to support(HR 1069/S 397) [Shut Down Child Prison Camps Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1069) and (S388) the [Families Not Facilities Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/388?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S388%22%5D%7D&s=5&r=1).  These bills would assure that all facilities complied with the Flores Act and they would also bar sharing information with ICE that could lead to the detention and deportation of sponsors in the community.  [We can also put pressure on banks that are financing private prisons.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article230326379.html?fbclid=IwAR13fQmVWSd8Q09dJVNaRxEfdEwjSv1UPoA_9NspW5ZYTHIBuTSy7PLu12w)  (H/T Rogan's List)
