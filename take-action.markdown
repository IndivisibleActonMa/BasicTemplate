* Tell MIT Not to Cooperate with ICE  

  Faculty and staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) received a memo telling them to expect a visit from the Department of Homeland Security and [asking them to cooperate with requests for information on the immigration status of researchers, visiting scholars and post-doctoral students at the university](https://commonwealthmagazine.org/immigration/mit-tells-staff-to-expect-visits-from-ice-2/?link_id=6&can_id=2367f63e076c12dadb092e1de7ba101c&source=email-january-11-mass-action-indivisible-newsletter-2&email_referrer=email_697784___subject_935158&email_subject=mass-action-indivisible-newsletter){:target="_blank"}.

  Let’s contact the President of MIT, Rafael Reif (president@mit.edu; 617-253-0148) and the author of this memo, Director of the International Scholars Office, Penny Rosser (pennysun@mit.edu; 617-253-2851) and ask them not to cooperate with an agency that has been recklessly deporting innocent people, separating children from their parents, and violating individuals’ basic human rights.

* Let's call Mitch McConnell at (202) 224-2541 and tell him that last week's mass shooting lies squarely at his feet. He needs to pass [HR 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8/text){:target="_blank"} and Red Flag laws now.

* Call your Members of Congress and explain that you object to imposing asylum application fees on people fleeing persecution and danger.
