### Workers Rally For a Just Recovery  

As we go into the Labor Day weekend, let us remember the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country.

**On Monday --- Labor Day -- September 7** we'll be joining allies from the labor movement and coalition partners from Raise Up Massachusetts for a [Workers Rally for a Just Recovery](https://actionnetwork.org/events/labor-day-action){:target="_blank"}.

**Lawmakers have a choice:** they can let deep budget cuts drive us deeper into a recession that exacerbates racial and economic inequities, or they can choose to invest in public services that improve public health, grow our economy, and reduce racial inequality. *Healthcare, transportation, education, safety net programs, and other critical areas of the state budget need more support now, not less.*

And it's up to us to make that choice clear.
