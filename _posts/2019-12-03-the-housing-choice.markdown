Lawmakers are currently in committee reconciling an economic development bill that will result in increased gentrification, evictions, and therefore homelessness in MA. During a pandemic, this goes beyond morality and is also a Public Health Danger. Furthermore, the burden will fall disproportionately on Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people of color, who are already suffering disproportionately from both the Pandemic and systemic racism.

Suggested script:\
“Hi Rep/Senator XX

This is _ calling/writing from __. Please vote against the so-called “Housing Choice” amendment in the Partnerships for Growth Bill HR 4879/S2842, now in reconciliation

This amendment will result in increased gentrification, evictions, and therefore homelessness in MA. During a pandemic, this goes beyond morality and is also a Public Health Danger. Furthermore, the burden will fall disproportionately on Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people of color, who are already suffering disproportionately from both the Pandemic and systemic racism.”  \\
