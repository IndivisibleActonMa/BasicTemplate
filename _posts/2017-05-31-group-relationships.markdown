### Relationships with Specific Issue Organizations MA Chapters
We know how to do events. We know how to communicate with each other and to make action happen. We know how to enjoy action.  What we lack is expertise. It is difficult for us to determine which bills to support, when and how to take action. It is difficult for us to build a state-wide strategy.

The answer is for us to build relationships with specific-issue organizations. Those groups know how, what and when to act on environmental, democracy, civil rights and election issues. 

Member Catherine Loeb went to a [350Mass Lowell Chapter](http://350mass.betterfutureproject.org/) chapter meeting. Through her they are sending two people to come talk to us about the environmental legislation in Massachusetts at our next meeting. 

Member Sue Funk brought in the [Environmental Voter Project](http://www.environmentalvoter.org/) to meet with us and they will guide us on how to bring in environmentalists as voters. 

Member Joris Wils built a relationship with [Lift Every Vote](https://www.facebook.com/groups/757413041078516/) on the Automatic Voter Registration bill. 

Member Monica Burke reached out to *individual campaigns* (Now: [Archie Parnell SC-05 on 6/20](https://archieparnell.com/) and [Jon Ossoff GA-06 on 6/20](http://electjon.com)) to support the Special Elections.
