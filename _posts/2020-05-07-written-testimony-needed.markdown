<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.5em; color:red;">**ANNOUNCEMENT:**</span>

<span style="font-size:1.25em;">Call to Action before <span style="color:red;">**Monday May 11, 2020**</span> to register your opposition to bill [H.4650, "An Act to Mitigate Arbovirus in the Commonwealth](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H4650){:target="_blank"}</span>

The [Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions](https://www.maccweb.org/){:target="_blank"}  opposes the bill.  They are concerned about its broad overreach.

Here are their main concerns:

1. **This bill is much too broad.**  It overrules all other statutes (including the Pesticide Control Act, Massachusetts Endangered Species Act, water supply protection laws, Open Meeting Law, Public Records Act, etc.) as well as decisions by municipalities to not join a regional district because they donâ€™t want nuisance mosquito spraying.  

2. **This bill would also overrule private property requests for exclusion from spraying.** Inadvertent impacts from spraying are not considered.  

3. **There is no transparency on the decision making process in this bill.**  There is no information about the actions to be taken, and there is no role for local boards of health or environmental groups.  

4. **There are no requirements for notifications to communities or property owners prior to spraying.**  There is no information on the effectiveness or trigger points for spraying or other actions.  

5. **There is no sunset provision to this bill.**  

*Without oversight, transparency or coordination with other agencies, this bill could do more harm than good.*.
