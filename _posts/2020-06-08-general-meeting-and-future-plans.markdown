### This is a *BIG* year!!

Feeling quarantine fatigue?  Join us for our June  General Meeting!

***Zoom*** in to get an update on our [Win 2020 Flip the Senate Campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/win2020personalmonthlystrategy/home){:target="_blank"} and learn what actions you can take from home.

Please join us to hear amazing activist Rebecca Riccio of Swing Left share moving stories from the field and talk about the work we have to do to get to November.

We will also hear about what's going on with Indivisible Massachusetts, and upcoming campaigns and candidates that need our support.

Let's advocate for the solutions we need and want!

### We have a lot of work to do!
