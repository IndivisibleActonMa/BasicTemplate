### This is a *BIG* year!!

***Zoom*** in to get an update on our [Win 2020 Flip the Senate Campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/win2020personalmonthlystrategy/home){:target="_blank"} and learn what actions you can take from home.

This crisis is an opportunity to take action on the systemic problems in America - Healthcare, Climate Change, Immigration, etc.

Let's advocate for the solutions we need and want!
