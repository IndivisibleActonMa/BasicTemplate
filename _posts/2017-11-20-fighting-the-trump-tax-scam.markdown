**MoveOn Calling**
They're calling voters in the districts of Republicans Rep. Tom MacArthur of NJ, Rep. Brian Mast of FL and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of FL. These members of Congress voted yes on the most recent slew of bad bills including the GOP tax plan and ACA repeal. It's time they hear from their constituents loud and clear - this is NOT ok.

The HubDialer is up and running today and this week. Sign in using the information below and recommit defending the ACA.

**MoveOn has set up texting and calling**. You can text constituents in states with vulnerable Members of Congress above and ask them to call. The text you send will provide them a phone number that will coach the constituent and direct their call making it super easy. The texters report high response rates, because people care. 
Sign up [here](https://act.moveon.org/survey/mo-text-team-schedule/).

In both cases you do not expose your phone number. The number the callee sees is provided by the service.
