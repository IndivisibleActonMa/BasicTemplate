### Action in MA -  Contact our legislators, Governor Baker

Time is of the essence. 

### ROE Act

* [Urge your lawmakers to reject Governor Baker's amendment undermining abortion access](https://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/a/urge-gov-amdt){:target="_blank"}.

### Police Reform

[Police Reform Bill in Limbo](Baker’s suggested revisions are now in the hands of the Senate’s Third Reading Committee, chaired by state Sen. Sal DiDomenico, D-Everett.){:target="_blank"}.

[Here is what is in the reform bill](https://www.progressivemass.com/police-reform-bill-conference-report-2020){:target="_blank"}.

### Emergency Paid Sick Time

We are sad to report that ***emergency paid sick time didn't even get a vote or a debate.***
Read more about it [HERE](https://www.progressivemass.com/nov-2020-house-budget-roll-call){:target="_blank"}.

### Climate Action

We must push our MA Legislature to advocate for strong and effective legislation during their committee discussions of the climate bill.

See a comparison of the two bills [HERE](http://climateactionnowma.org/wp-content/uploads/ClimateBillsComparisonAug2020.pdf){:target="_blank"} and write to your Representative, Senator and encourage them to write to the Conference Committee to enact stronger climate legislation in Massachusetts - or thank them if they have already done so!

### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.

[Send an email](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dff-letter?source=direct_link&){:target="_blank"} to Governor Baker, your Senator and State Rep in support of the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act.

### Transparency is Power

Legislative rules get set at the start of every 2-year legislative session. NOW is our chance to change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House. Learn more [HERE](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).
