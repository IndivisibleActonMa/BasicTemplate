### Action in MA -  Contact our legislators, Governor Baker

Time is of the essence.

### Transparency is Power

Legislative rules get set at the start of every 2-year legislative session. NOW is our chance to change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House. Learn more [HERE](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).

### Climate Action

The Climate Bill was returned to the Senate with added amendments by Governor Baker on Feb 8. It is being reviewed in Senate Committee.

**PLEASE** ask your legislators to **NOT** water down the climate bill (**Do not accept any amendments that would weaken the bill**). If you have written already, you can write again to inquire about where the bill is and to reiterate the “**do not water down the climate bill**” message.

### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.
