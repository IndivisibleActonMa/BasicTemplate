### Action in MA -  Contact our legislators, Governor Baker

Time is of the essence.

### Transparency is Power

Legislative rules get set at the start of every 2-year legislative session. NOW is our chance to change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House. Learn more [HERE](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).

### Police Reform

### Climate Action

We are sad to report that ***Governor Baker vetoed the Climate Bill.***

[Speaker Mariano and Senate Leader Spilka pledged to refile the bill](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2021/01/13/house-speaker-mariano-refile-climate-bill-baker-veto){:target="_blank"}.  


### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driver’s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.

[Send an email](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dff-letter?source=direct_link&){:target="_blank"} to Governor Baker, your Senator and State Rep in support of the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act.

### ROE Act

* [Thank your lawmakers if they voted to pass this bill and rejected Governor Baker’s anti-choice amendments](https://malegislature.gov/search/findmylegislator){:target="_blank"}.  

### Emergency Paid Sick Time

We are sad to report that ***emergency paid sick time didn't even get a vote or a debate.***
