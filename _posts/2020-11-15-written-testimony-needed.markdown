### Action in MA -  Contact Governor Baker

Time is of the essence. Governor Baker received the budget Friday, Dec 4. We need him to act!

### ROE Act

* [Urge your lawmakers to reject Governor Baker's amendment undermining abortion access](https://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/a/urge-gov-amdt){:target="_blank"}.

### Police Reform

[Baker threatens veto of Police Reform Bill without his amendments](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/12/10/massachusetts-governor-proposed-amendments-policing-legislation).

***[Please contact your legislators and tell them you do not want a watered down police reform bill](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dont-let-governor-baker-weaken-the-police-reform-bill/){:target="_blank"}***.

[Here is what is in the reform bill](https://www.progressivemass.com/police-reform-bill-conference-report-2020){:target="_blank"}.

### Emergency Paid Sick Time

We are sad to report that ***emergency paid sick time didn't even get a vote or a debate.***
Read more about it [HERE](https://www.progressivemass.com/nov-2020-house-budget-roll-call){:target="_blank"}.

### Climate Action

We must push our MA Legislature to advocate for strong and effective legislation during their committee discussions of the climate bill.

See a comparison of the two bills [HERE](http://climateactionnowma.org/wp-content/uploads/ClimateBillsComparisonAug2020.pdf){:target="_blank"} and write to your Representative, Senator and encourage them to write to the Conference Committee to enact stronger climate legislation in Massachusetts - or thank them if they have already done so!

### Driving Families Forward

Doesn't it make sense to enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard state driverâ€™s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements?  It has been endorsed by over 230 organizations, including the Mass. Major City Chiefs of Police, as well as dozens of businesses.

Read more [HERE](https://www.miracoalition.org/get-involved/drivers-licenses/){:target="_blank"} about how you can take action.

[Send an email](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dff-letter?source=direct_link&){:target="_blank"} to Governor Baker, your Senator and State Rep in support of the passage of the Work and Family Mobility Act.

### Advocacy Day! Justice Can't Wait!

There is still time to influence Beacon Hill and signal to our legislators that we want them to continue to advance important legislation before this session ends.

[Nine important bills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vKsvgbgPbBakiaxa4JMuvLFBflpM1P5ZRfb3eFY3_k/edit){:target="_blank"} need to pass before the legislative session ends on Dec 31st.  The Safe Communities Coalition is co-sponsoring this *virtual lobby day on Thursday, Dec 10.*

The plan is to focus on State Representatives. A team of volunteers is setting up meetings for everyone who registers (groups of 2 or more people). We're trying for meetings between 1-3p, Dec 10. If no meeting can be set up there  will be an email template provided to help you communicate with your legislator and participate in this action.

Please [register HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhgnAZsAyriaCbFx0UYn9E2mjA6phVdqei7jvamQLZNY62bw/viewform){:target="_blank"} **by Dec 6, 9p**.

### Transparency is Power

Legislative rules get set at the start of every 2-year legislative session. NOW is our chance to change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House. Learn more [HERE](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).
