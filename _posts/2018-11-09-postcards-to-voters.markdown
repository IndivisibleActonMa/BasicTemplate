Feeling like you can't stop persisting?  [Postcards To Voters](https://postcardstovoters.org) has launched [Campaign 137: Mike Espy for U.S. Senate from Mississippi](https://postcardstovoters.org/2018/11/09/espy/).

This Special Election Runoff election will be **Nov. 27**.

Mike is the first African American from Mississippi elected to the U.S. House since the 1800s. (More about Mike at [Mississippi Today](https://mississippitoday.org/2018/10/29/mike-espy-32-years-after-historic-victory-and-fall-hopes-to-rise-to-moment-again/?link_id=3&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e&source=email-party-time-2&email_referrer=email_452820&email_subject=thank-you-and-party-time).)

Let's channel our excitement about Tuesday's Midterms by writing 5 postcards to Mississippi voters for this important special election.
