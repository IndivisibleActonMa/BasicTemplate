To organize an event not much is needed:

* Decide on a date, time, duration and location

* Provide a title and a description.

* Post about it on Facebook:
[Video Tutorial: How to announce and share an event on Facebook](https://youtu.be/Pt8IsVoY8ts)
  -) Post the event on the group's *public* page [https://www.facebook.com/IndivisibleActon/](https://www.facebook.com/IndivisibleActon/)
  -) Copy the link from the top browser bar.
  -) Share the post to the group's *private* page
[https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndivisibleActon/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndivisibleActon/)
  -) Ask to share the post to other groups by emailing [jeanie@indivisibleacton.org](mailto:jeanie@indivisibleacton.org) 

* Optionally: create a signup with [The Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) -preferred- OR [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) whatever tool you like.

* Add the events to the group's calendar by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceZqvFrTjQSVDc-NH12WPMV0vHF853zF3NPtmIQCNzIHcqjw/viewform).
The form will ask to include *the link* to your Facebook post or Action Network event. In that way, people can click on the link in the calendar entry for up to date information.

* Post it into the newsletter. 
Preferred: add a blurb the #ia_newsletter channel on IA Slack. Include *the link* above.
Alternative: send an email to newsletter@indivisibleacton.org.

If you need to update the entry in the calendar email \[Joris\](mailto: Joris@indivisibleacton.org)
