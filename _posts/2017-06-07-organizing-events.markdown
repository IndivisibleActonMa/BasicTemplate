To organize an event not much is needed:

* Decide on a date, time, duration and location

* Provide a title and a description.

* Optionally: create a signup with [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) or [The Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org) or whatever tool you like

* Add the events to the calendar by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceZqvFrTjQSVDc-NH12WPMV0vHF853zF3NPtmIQCNzIHcqjw/viewform).

* Post about it on Facebook:

* Get it into the newsletter. 
Preferred: add a blurb the #ia_newsletter channel on IA Slack.
Alternative: send an email to newsletter@indivisibleacton.org

If you need to update the entry in the calendar email \[Joris\](mailto: Joris@indivisibleacton.org)
