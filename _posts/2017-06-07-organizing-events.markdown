To organize an event not much is needed:
* Decide on a date, time, duration and location
* Provide a title and a description. 
* Optionally: create a signup with [eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) or [actionnetwork](http://actionnetwork.org) or whatever tool you like
* Add the events to the calendar by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceZqvFrTjQSVDc-NH12WPMV0vHF853zF3NPtmIQCNzIHcqjw/viewform).

* Post about it on Facebook as often as you like to promote it. The more the better.
* Send an email to our[google group](mailto:indivisibleacton@groups.google.com)

If you need to update the entry in the calendar email [Joris](mailto:Send email to mailto:jjmwguard-indivisible@yahoo.com )
