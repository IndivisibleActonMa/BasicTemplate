Please join us on Friday at the Burlington ICE office from 3pm-5pm to keep Nelson home.

Nelson Fuentes is a community leader from Lawrence, MA. He was detained by ICE last summer and has been fighting his case since. This Friday his initial stay of removal is up, meaning that ICE might decide to deport him, separating him from his baby daughter, family, and community.

On Friday afternoon, [Cosecha](https://www.lahuelga.com){:target="_blank"} be delivering a petition to the Boston ICE director, Todd Lyons, to ask him to grant Nelson a discretionary stay.
