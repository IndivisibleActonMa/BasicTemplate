From **June through October**, all funds we raise will be matched **one-for-one**, up to **$500** by **Indivisible's Distributed Fundraising program**.

Matching funds will be transferred the first week of each month. The amount we receive will equal the total funds that we fundraised over the previous 4 weeks. So if we raise $100 in June, we will receive $100 for the match in early July.  Other fundraising rules still apply.

We can spend money on :

* Public registration

* Group building

* Lobbying

* Some federal political spending (not state & local)
