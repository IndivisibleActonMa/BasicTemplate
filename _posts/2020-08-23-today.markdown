### Drumbeat to your Members of Congress: Protect our Elections and the USPS!

Trump and his administration are endangering our elections. Our Members of Congress need to hear a constant, daily drumbeat of constituent input at this crucial point in history every day!

### [#SaveThePostOffice](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/savethepostoffice?__eep__=6&source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG){:target="_blank"} Primer

***Please share!***

PLEASE use your personal networks to promote the following message: *If not reversed, the damage already done to the USPS will continue to hurt Americans who rely on the mail to receive medicine, pay their rent and bills, and manage other essentials of their personal and professional lives. Politicians shouldn’t talk about the post office “losing money” any more than we talk about the military "losing money" – it’s a service that we should be able to rely on. The USPS should not be used as a political weapon to undermine our democracy.*

We need everyone who wants their voice to count in this election to **make a plan to vote**. 

Everyone should:  

1. Request their mail-in ballot early. This is already possible in many states.

2. Complete the ballot as soon as it arrives, paying meticulous attention to the instructions. Don’t let your ballot be discounted because of human error!

3. If there is a safe dropbox option in your town or city, use it. Make sure you're using your local dropbox.

4. Check the status of your mail-in ballot after you drop it off and well before the election. Contact the appropriate office in your town or city government to find out what the confirmation process is.

5. Share this message with your networks. This must be a massive grassroots effort.

Additional news and action items:

• With a vote of 257-150, the House passed a bill yesterday that would provide the needed $25 billion for the Post Office to operations as usual during COVID. The bill also blocks Dejoy's sabotage of the postal service. Activists will be trying to pressure the Senate to take action to protect the USPS this week.

• Standup America has set up a coalition number that anyone can use to make calls to the Senate: 833-828-9069. This number provides talking points and connects the caller to their Senator.

Finally, National Urban League, Common Cause, and League of Women Voters of the U.S. joined together in a lawsuit that demands that the steps taken to slow USPS service "should be enjoined and ordered reversed to ensure that the Postal Service provides effective mail service in the upcoming election and to prevent the denial or abridgement of the right to vote for tens of thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of Americans." You can read the document here: [https://www.commoncause.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USPS-Suit-8-18-20.pdf](https://www.commoncause.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USPS-Suit-8-18-20.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

This fight really matters. Let’s keep it up. And please stay safe out there.
