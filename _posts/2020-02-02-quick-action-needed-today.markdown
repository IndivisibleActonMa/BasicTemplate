McConnell and the Senate GOP are about to acquit Donald Trump, despite the mountains of evidence that the House uncovered throughout the impeachment hearings. They ignored that 75% of Americans wanted to hear from witnesses like John Bolton, to force through their coverup. *We know that **this wasn’t a fair trial** and that **Trump has not been exonerated**.*

Join us on Wednesday, February 5th to show that we will be holding the President and GOP Senators accountable.

It’s clear that Trump used military aid to pressure a foreign government into doing his political bidding and then tried to cover it up. Mitch McConnell and GOP Senators are now complicit in Trump’s criminal activity.

Join us at any one of these events to **REJECT THE COVERUP:**
