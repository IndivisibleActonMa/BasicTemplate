McConnell and the Senate GOP are about to acquit Donald Trump, despite the mountains of evidence that the House uncovered throughout the impeachment hearings. They ignored that 75% of Americans wanted to hear from witnesses like John Bolton, to force through their coverup. *We know that **this wasn’t a fair trial** and that **Trump has not been exonerated**.*

Join us on Wednesday, February 5th to show that we will be holding the President and GOP Senators accountable.
