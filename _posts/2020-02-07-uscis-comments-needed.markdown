### Comment Now on Proposed Changes to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

**Under new rules proposed by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), designers of big projects would no longer have to take into account climate change considerations or the fifty-year old National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).**

This move is *in addition to 95 other environmental policy rollbacks over the last three years*, the [New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html){:target="_blank"}, and 70 lawsuits have been filed challenging these changes. (As of last summer, many of these had prevailed, according to the State of the Planet.)

These new rules would exempt significant infrastructure projects–such as pipelines–from clean air and water requirements, and would prevent communities from objecting to projects that would impact them, according to the Washington Post.

Columbia University School of Law’s Climate Law Blog points out that the changes would eliminate the requirement to consider “cumulative” environmental impact, meaning that each proposed project would be considered in isolation regardless of other projects/conditions in the same location.

The proposed changes would also eliminate consideration of significant parts of “indirect” environmental effects—which are not necessarily indirect at all, but are those effects that will take place over time, rather than immediately. Only “reasonably foreseeable” effects would have to be considered, with “reasonably foreseeable” being defined as that which “a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision,” suggesting that environmental threats that require expertise to predict might be excluded.

ARGUE that weakening environmental protections at a moment when the future of our planet is at a topping point is illogical at best and suicidal at worst.  **Note**: Be sure to refer to docket number CEQ-2019-0003
