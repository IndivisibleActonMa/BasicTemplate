Like what you saw in Alabama and Virginia? Help flip (PA-18) blue on March 13th.

THE PHONE-BANK IS UP & RUNNING (LINK BELOW). Texting coming soon!

*** Help Elect Democrat Conor Lamb (PA-18) to Congress ***
If you can to help, please email monica@indivisibleacton.org.

*** Background:

There are more Dems (46.4%) than Republicans (41.4%); however, the district went for Trump in 2016.

This seat is open following the resignation of Tim Murphy, the married anti-choice hypocrite who urged his girlfriend to get an abortion. The Republican running for this seat, Rick Saccone, is a far-right extremist who proudly boosts that he was "Trump before Trump was Trump."

*** Phonebank for Community Forum to build volunteer base:

Voice of Westmoreland, a resistance group near Pittsburgh, has a community forum scheduled for January 13th to organize volunteers. We need to help get as many potential volunteers to this meeting as possible, so we are calling registered Democrats in Westmoreland County who are likely to be strong supporters of candidate Conor Lamb. Phone calls can be made now until January 12th. https://www.openvpb.com/vpb_bycode/E90342E-1837

If you get a voicemail, you can leave a message using the script provided at the end of the page (but please mark "I couldn't reach (voter)" so we can try to reach them in person later.

Our first virtual phonebank in 2018 will be to support local grassroots resistance group Voice of Westmoreland. Westmoreland County is one of the redder, more rural parts of the 18th Congressional District. We believe there are more than 100,000 doors of Democratic voters to be knocked to raise the profile of this special election. With your help, we will recruit progressive people from across Westmoreland to a Community Forum to kickoff our plan to win in 2018.

Will you help us recruit more boots on the ground in Westmoreland County? The Community Forum will take place on January 13th, so you can make calls at any time between January 2 and 12th. We have about 9000 phone numbers to call, so we can put lots of folks to work. We are working with local partners to plan a similar event in Washington County on January 27th. And of course, we will organize virtual phone banks to reach voters directly as well.
