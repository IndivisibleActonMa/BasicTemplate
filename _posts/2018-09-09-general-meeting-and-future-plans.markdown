Indivisible Acton's General Meeting will be September 10th at the Acton Memorial Library 6:30-8:30 PM. 

During our Social 1/2 Hour we will be joined by Quentin Palfrey, Tami Gouveia, and possibly Jamie Eldridge and Jay Gonzalez. 

We'll also have a New Member Orientation as part of the meeting and we will discuss plans for the November election from supporting candidates to ballot questions!
