From Indivisible Westford:

We must take a stand in Massachusetts to protect our immigrant residents from ICE targeting.  The best way to do this is to support the Safe Communities Act.  The Safe Community Act is stalled, but the senate did pass 4 provisions in the budget and we are asking the House to do the same.

The 4 provisions are:

1. **NO POLICE INQUIRIES ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS**

2. **STOP COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH ICE**
   We can prohibit contracts with ICE – like 287(g) – that deputize law enforcement as federal immigration agents, at state and local taxpayers’ expense.

3. **PROVIDE BASIC DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS**

4. **REFUSE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANY DISCRIMINATORY REGISTRY**

**If you're on twitter**, please tweet the *Globe* editorial and tag your state Rep and Speaker DeLeo.  For example:

* Immigrant families are being torn apart, and Mass. sheriffs are *helping*??? @YourRepsHandle put a stop to this ASAP! Make sure FY2019 state budget includes basic protections for immigrants! #FamiliesNotFear https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/06/14/modest-immigration-reforms-mass-could-send-powerful-message/wnGpYDUZ6w1gy8iZ9QUPcL/story.html


* How can we celebrate #FathersDay when ICE is using Mass. law enforcement to help deport dads? @YourRepsHandle @SpeakerDeLeo choose #FamiliesNotFear – include basic protections & 287(g) ban in FY2019 budget! https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/06/14/modest-immigration-reforms-mass-could-send-powerful-message/wnGpYDUZ6w1gy8iZ9QUPcL/story.html


* The [MIRA feed](https://twitter.com/MIRACoalition) also has lots of live-tweets from both demonstrations ([this one](https://twitter.com/MIRACoalition/status/1007316786386210816) was particularly popular), which you can retweet with comments like:  *Mass. can’t be complicit in destroying families! @YourRepsHandle @SpeakerDeLeo, this #FathersDay, will you pledge to protect immigrants in the FY2019 budget?*

**If you're on Facebook**, look up your Rep and if they have a page, post the Globe editorial to it (if someone else already did it, just add your supportive comments). Here’s the link again: https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2018/06/14/modest-immigration-reforms-mass-could-send-powerful-message/wnGpYDUZ6w1gy8iZ9QUPcL/story.html

You can use the blurbs provided for Twitter, just without hashtags or @handles, or add your own personal comment.

If your Rep doesn’t have a page, please post the Globe editorial and/or coverage of the two demonstrations on your personal page.

**Send an email to your State Rep** (even if you’ve already called). Find contact info [here](https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator)), and another to Chairman Sánchez (jeffrey.sanchez@mahouse.gov) and another to Speaker DeLeo (robert.deleo@mahouse.gov). Keep it short and sweet, and include a link to the Globe editorial.

Here’s sample text you can use:

Dear Rep. \[ *name* \]:

As we celebrate Father’s Day this weekend, I am shocked and ashamed that our government is deliberately traumatizing children and parents at the border. I am also shocked that, in the face of egregious immigration enforcement practices, the Mass. House has done NOTHING to protect families within our Commonwealth.

The FY2019 budget offers an immediate opportunity to right that wrong. Please make sure that the basic protections adopted in the Senate budget are included in the final version! The very least we can do for immigrant families is make sure our police and sheriffs aren’t helping to tear them apart.

Thank you for standing up for ALL your constituents!
