TODAY, the MA state Senate will vote on [S.2459](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2459){:target="_blank"}, also known as the Healthy Youth Act.

**Can you contact your State Senator now and urge them to support the Healthy Youth Act?**

If passed, the Healthy Youth Act will mandate that schools offering sexual education classes must teach a medically accurate and comprehensive curriculum.

The bill as currently drafted allows parents to opt their children out of this curriculum if they so choose. However, **anti-choice State Senator Dean Tran has filed an amendment which would require each town to have a vote on implementing comprehensive sex ed, a barrier designed to severely reduce the number of young people accessing this education.** This is an attempt to gut this bill because Senator Tran fundamentally doesn’t believe in giving young people factual information about sexual health.

Take two minutes now to contact your State Senator and urge them to support the ROE Act and oppose Senator Tran’s amendment!  

Facts - *especially those about sexual and reproductive health* - matter now more than ever. While the Trump Administration is doing all it can to deny young people and adults alike access to comprehensive reproductive and sexual health information, Massachusetts legislators are leading the path forward with the Healthy Youth Act.

In a time of unprecedented attacks on medically accurate information and access to health care, we must fight to ensure that Massachusetts is a beacon of reproductive freedom.
