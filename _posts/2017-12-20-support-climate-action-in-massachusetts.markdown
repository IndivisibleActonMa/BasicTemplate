On 12/11/2017 we had two visitors from the Elder Climate Action, who presented an overview of Climate Change legislation in MA. They make the case to pass the Global Warming Solutions Implementation Act (GWSIA),  because it has a high chance of passing and encompasses the developments of the last few years.
