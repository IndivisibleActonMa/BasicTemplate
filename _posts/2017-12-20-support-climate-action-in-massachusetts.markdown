### WE AREN’T DONE YET!  WE HAVE TO KEEP THE PRESSURE UP ON OUR LEGISLATORS AND INSIST ON PUBLIC POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE SCIENTIFIC FACTS - NOT THE DEMANDS OF CORPORATE LOBBYISTS.  

350MA and it’s partners have more actions planned in the next few weeks - a **CALL-IN DAY (April 23rd)** and a **LOBBY DAY (May 10th)** at the State House where they will deliver post cards and meet with lawmakers.  Please join us!!

There are bills in the works right now that could make Massachusetts a leader in the fight against climate change. One in particular, the [OMNIBUS CLEAN ENERGY BILL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rnBqBK7nR9KUvOx-zIq9IPgyR74cZxhp/view?usp=sharing), would be a crucial step in this direction. But industry lobbyists oppose these bills, so we need to counter them with people power. That’s why we’ve selected a few key days of action.

To sign up for either the Call-In Day or the Lobby Day, use this link:

Here is the legislation we are fighting for:
