Thank you to the RJ Grey Jr. High Social Action Club members and their classmates who wrote [a letter to the community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bxOqB21w7-pdIyj9RRR58-hv_6bCN6D4/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} denouncing the hate-filled, racist incidents at the recent school committee meetings. 

To the students, thank you for taking action and lifting your voices on this very important issue in the community.
