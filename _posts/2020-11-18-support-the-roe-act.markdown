### [Gov. Baker vetoed bill to protect and expand abortion access in MA](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/24/metro/governor-baker-vetoes-bill-protect-expand-abortion-access-mass/){:target="_blank"}. 

[Will you contact your state lawmakers and urge them to reject Gov. Baker’s amendment](https://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/a/urge-gov-amdt){:target="_blank"}?  

By ignoring the advice of medical experts and maintaining outdated abortion laws, Governor Baker has proven that he’s out of touch—and young people of color and young people with low incomes will be the ones to pay the price. **We must now turn back to the state legislature to once again stand up for patients and reject his proposed amendments.**

The provisions of the ROE Act that moved forward in the state budget are a commonsense compromise of what we fought for in the bill. **Abortion is health care, and patients in Massachusetts, even young people, deserve access to that care.** [Please contact your state lawmakers to reject Governor Baker’s amendments](https://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/a/urge-gov-amdt){:target="_blank"}.

### Prochoice Amendment 180 passes the MA Senate

The MA Senate just took a major step towards removing barriers to abortion care by overwhelmingly adopting Amendment #180 with a vote of 33 - 7 and rejecting 3 anti-choice amendments!

Amendment #180 contains essential ROE Act provisions and will:

* codify the right to abortion care into state law

* allow 16-17 year-olds to make decisions about their health care

* streamlines the judicial bypass process

* allows families who have received a lethal fetal diagnosis to get the compassionate care they need right here in Massachusetts

[Thank your State Senator for voting in favor of this critically important amendment!](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/thank-your-senator-for-voting-to-improve-abortion-access?clear_id=true){:target="_blank"}.

From here, this amendment goes to conference to reconcile any differences between the House and Senate version before being sent to Governor Baker's desk.

**What's Next**

The state budget landed on Governor Baker's desk Friday, Dec. 4. Time is of the essence!
