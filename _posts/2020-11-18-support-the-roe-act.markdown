### Prochoice Amendment 180 passes the MA Senate

The MA Senate just took a major step towards removing barriers to abortion care by overwhelmingly adopting Amendment #180 with a vote of 33 - 7 and rejecting 3 anti-choice amendments!

Amendment #180 contains essential ROE Act provisions and will:

* codify the right to abortion care into state law

* allow 16-17 year-olds to make decisions about their health care

* streamlines the judicial bypass process

* allows families who have received a lethal fetal diagnosis to get the compassionate care they need right here in Massachusetts

[Thank your State Senator for voting in favor of this critically important amendment!](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/thank-your-senator-for-voting-to-improve-abortion-access?clear_id=true){:target="_blank"}.

From here, this amendment goes to conference to reconcile any differences between the House and Senate version before being sent to Governor Baker's desk.
