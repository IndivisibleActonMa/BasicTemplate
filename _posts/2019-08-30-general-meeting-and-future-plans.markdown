Come hear inspiring speakers and then join us for take action breakouts at Indivisible Acton's September General Meeting **Monday, September 16 at the Acton Memorial Library, 6:30-8:45p**.  

*Olivia Santoro*, volunteer coordinator for ACLU will talk about the ROE Act, a state bill that would protect and expand reproductive rights in MA.  


*Jeanine Wood*, Indivisible Acton member, will tell us about her experience "adopting" a candidate.  

Find out how **you** can take action in a variety of ways (quick and easy or more involved) to help pass the ROE Act and/or elect progressive candidates.  

Social half hour starts at 6:30pm and the meeting starts at 7pm.

Look forward to seeing you!!
