Indivisible is massive. The Tea Party grew to **one thousand** chapters and now has shrunk to about half that. Indivisible has **six thousand** chapters and counting! And thatâ€™s just Indivisible, we are only a part of the Resistance. There is also Our Revolution, Swing Left etc. We are huge, we are organized, we are informed and we are having an impact. We are now reaching out to other organizations to build coalitions. We can change our towns, our states, our country and our world. We are humble. We know that we are on a long journey, perhaps the most important journey of our lives, because the future of our children is at stake.
[Indivisible National](http://https://www.indivisibleguide.com/) has been reaching out to the thousands of chapters around the country. Our contributions have enabled them to hire a small staff. I have had a conversation with Marguerite Suozza-Gole a Massachusetts native, who is the contact person for the 800 groups in the New England/Mid Atlantic states. They are looking for ways to help the chapters.
Among others, Indivisible National has set up a communication channels with the mobilize.io tool through which chapter representatives can communicate. These channels are per state and per topic. I have not had much time to keep up with this.
