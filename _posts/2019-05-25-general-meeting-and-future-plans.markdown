Please join us at Indivisible Acton's June General Meeting **Monday, Jun 10 at the Acton Memorial Library, 6:30-8:30p**.

Social half hour starts at 6:30pm and the meeting starts at 7pm.

Our June meeting features an eye witness account of immigration on the southern border presented by **Rabbi Mike from Congregation Beth Elohim** and **the founders of [Dignity in Asylum](https://www.dignityinasylum.org)** who will help us understand how we can get involved and offer protection to those seeking asylum in our community.

Look forward to seeing you!!

**Dignity in Asylum** has let us know they often need personal care items for their clients. We will provide a box to collect personal care items at the **June 10 **meeting. If you can, we ask you to bring personal care items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, soap or shampoo and we'll collect the items and hand them off to Dignity in Asylum.
