We are requesting help from members to write to your state representatives to sponsor the AVR bill: H.2091. We are asking that the members write postcards to their state representative/senator in addition to MA House Speaker Robert DeLeo.

The postcard to Speaker DeLeo is a request to bring the AVR bill to vote! 
If your local representative is a co-sponsor of the AVR bill, we are asking you to send a 'Thank You!' postcard.
If your  local representative is NOT a co-sponsor of the AVR bill, we are asking to send a postcard and/or call their office requesting him/her to support this bill.

The instructions on how to write these postcards is detailed here: [https://lifteveryvote.net/postcard-parties/](https://lifteveryvote.net/postcard-parties/)
