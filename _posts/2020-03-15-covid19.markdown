### PROTECT MA PRISONERS FROM COVID19.
 
Prisoners are dying. Social distancing is not possible in the prisons, nor proper sanitation. The only way to prevent deaths among both workers and prisoners is to reduce the prison population.  Prisons and jails are not equipped to isolate or treat the ill and  local hospitals could end up inundated by prisoners.  

Click [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zii0rLwy1wE5iUtRUCkMbRc4LdXymTvDp8MSfX7ljgs/){:target="_blank"} to learn how **YOU** *can help*.
