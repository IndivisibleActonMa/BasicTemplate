### Take Action in 2021

*Now, as we head into a new Democratic trifecta, history is poised to repeat itself. Mitch McConnell has declared himself the “Grim Reaper” of all legislation in the Biden era, and his threat is even more grave because Democrats hold this trifecta through a slim 50/50 split with Vice President Harris as the deciding vote. But that’s not a reason to give up; it’s a reason to fight harder.*  
~From A Practical Guide for Fixing our Democracy

### Democracy is an action word!
