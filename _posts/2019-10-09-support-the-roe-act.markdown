Indivisible Acton Area supports the **ROE Act** for reproductive rights.  We are writing postcards to our fellow voters asking them to contact their lawmakers and ask them to support the **ROE Act**.

The next two months are *critical* because the legislators take a break on November 20, so we want to generate as *many calls as possible*!

Contact Linda ***roeact2019@gmail.com*** for more info.
