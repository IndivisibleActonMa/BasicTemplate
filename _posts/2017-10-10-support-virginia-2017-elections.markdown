Update: we may change to what Indivisible has set up: [https://www.indivisible.org/gotv-virginia](https://www.indivisible.org/gotv-virginia)

Indivisible Acton is supporting Democrats in the **November Virginia Elections** through texting all delegates and calling for two assigned delegates. 

These are the elections for Governor, Attorney General and the House of Delegates.  The Sister District Project (SDP) has assigned Indivisible Acton two Delegates to support: [John Bell](http://www.johnbellfordelegate.com/) (87th district) and [Jennifer Foy](https://www.jennifercarrollfoy.org/) (2d district)

The texting effort is being coordinated by Joris: [joris@indivisibleacton.org](mailto:joris@indivisibleacton.org) To take part read the instructions below and a) register as instructed or b) you can use some shared accounts to which Joris can provide you the login info. Texting uses your computer, not your phone.

The goals is to get the last text out this **final weekend of October**.

Information on how to take part below:

The Sister District Project is rolling out texting for the delegate races. They are working with the VA Democratic Party called Coordinated (and they are coordinating with Red2Blue who you may have heard of). Below links for training and info.
