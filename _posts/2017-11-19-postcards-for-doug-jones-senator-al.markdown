**Democrat Doug Jones** is running for US Senator of Alabama. The special election is Tuesday December 12. **Liberty and Justice for all has been Doug's life's work.**

We will be sending postcards to voters in AL up to 12/3. We hope voters will put our lovely cards on their fridges to remind them to vote. Gathering with kindred spirits to take action is the best medicine against the 45 blues.

We have postcard events planned for 11/21, 11/26, 11/28, 12/2 and 12/3. Come for an hour, chat, drink coffee and smile. See the [calendar](http://www.indivisibleacton.org/calendar.html) for exact dates, times and locations. 

If you want to do it yourself from home you have two options:
1) email joris@indivisibleacton.org and ask for addresses. Indicate the amount. A typical start is 25. Joris will send you addresses and instructions.
2) sign up through [https://www.facebook.com/TonyTheDemocrat.org/](https://www.facebook.com/TonyTheDemocrat.org/)
3) email join@tonythedemocrat.org. That's the grass roots group that's running this.

So far they have given out over 130,000 addresses!
