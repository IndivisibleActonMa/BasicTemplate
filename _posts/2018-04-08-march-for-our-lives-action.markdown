### A message from a host of your March for Our Lives Events event:

We are coming down to the wire for the following bills:

* [Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO)](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3610.Html) - the anti-gun violence bill

* [An Act to Promote a Clean Energy Future](http://mapowerforward.com/files/powerforward/Legislation20172018/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20S2302%20-%20An%20Act%20to%20Promote%20a%20Clean%20Energy%20Future%20-%20%203-2-18.pdf)

* [Bill H.4320](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H4320) An act automatically registering elibible voters and enhancing safeguards against fraud.

### These bills need to get out of committee ***this week*** or they will die for the next two years.

Please use this [link to have an email sent to your state legislators to support these bills.](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/erpo-bill?source=direct_link&)

If you live in ***Lowell*** or ***Chelmsford***, we ***really need you***! It's your reps Nangle and Golden that are the committee chairs. They are not in support yet and they will only listen to *their* constituents!

### And yes, *these emails DO make a difference if enough of them come in*!
