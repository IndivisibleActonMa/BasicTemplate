We are in the home stretch for the drivers licenses campaign so it's all hands on deck!

[The Work and Family Mobility Act](https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/work_and_family_mobily_act.pdf){:target="_blank"} would enable all qualified state residents to apply for a standard Massachusetts driverâ€™s license, regardless of immigrant status, while keeping our Commonwealth in full compliance with REAL ID requirements.

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em; color:red">The Work and Family Mobility Act needs to be passed by **TUESDAY, July 21**.</span>

Immigrant leaders from across the state have decided that they will CAMP OUT at the state house Friday-Tuesday to demonstrate just how urgently the community needs drivers licenses.

We need 24/7 marshal coverage and lots of food and water donations!
