We are fortunate that a group of people in Carlisle took on building a network of the Indivisible-like groups in the region. This network, called the Group of Groups (the GoG) is roughly geographically centered around Acton. It consists of 20 or so groups from about as many towns. 
The purpose of the GoG is to provide a means to network regionally. It is a means for group leaders to meet and for groups to coordinate and learn from each other. It is not a decision making, top-down, body.
The GoG meets monthly, now at the same church as we meet, and it has an active Slack group. Each group has provided a number of members, who are in the Slack group. The Slack group has channels like ours for each issue. For example there are channels for democracy, elections and environment.  Right now Acton members Monica Burke and Catherine & Jeff Loeb are active in those channels respectively. Monica has already led two regional meetings on coordinating election action.
The leaders of the GoG maintain relationships with National and other regional groups in Massachusetts.
