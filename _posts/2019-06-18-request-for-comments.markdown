**What you can do:**

**You have until Friday June 21, 2019 to submit comments. **You have several options:

* Submit your comments online on the Office of Management and Budget’s [website form](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=OMB-2019-0002-0001). Note that on this website you do NOT have to provide your name or contact info, so if you want to talk about something personal anonymously, you can do that. You also have the option to submit a comment for someone else – you can tell the story of someone who needed government benefits to live, for example.

* You can also use [this form on the Federal Register website](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/07/2019-09106/request-for-comment-on-the-consumer-inflation-measures-produced-by-federal-statistical-agencies#open-comment) to submit comments. Note that this doesn’t appear to offer the option of anonymity.

* You can fax comments to Nancy Potok, Chief Statistician, Office of Management and Budget, 202-395-7245.

* You can email comments to [Statistical_Directives@omb.eop.gov](mailto:Statistical_Directives@omb.eop.gov) with the subject line “Directive No. 14”
