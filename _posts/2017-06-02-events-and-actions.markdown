It is at events and actions that we make change happen. In groups, we use our hands and our feet to take action. We march, we visit, we call and we write. Doing it as a group is inspiring and fun. Anyone is welcome to organize an event. Pick an issue, pick a venue, pick a time, post it on our Facebook group and send an email to our Google Group. Add a comment every day to your event post, so that it shows up in peopleâ€™s feeds.
