The Senate has joined the House in standing up for reproductive freedom by voting to override Governor Baker’s veto.

**The ROE Act provisions are now the law of the land in MA.**

For the past two years, we’ve been working tirelessly to protect and expand abortion access in Massachusetts by passing the ROE Act.

There were many roadblocks along the way, including Governor Baker’s two vetos ([he vetoed the legislation for the 2nd time on Christmas Eve](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/24/metro/governor-baker-vetoes-bill-protect-expand-abortion-access-mass/){:target="_blank"}).  But we refused to give up.

WE HAVE IMPROVED ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE AND THE RIGHT TO ABORTION CARE HAS BEEN CODIFIED INTO MASSACHUSETTS LAW!

While the legislation passed did not have everything the ROEAct Coalition championed, it contains essential provisions that will protect and improve access to reproductive health care for pregnant people in MA.

* Codifying the right to abortion in state law;

* Improving youth access by allowing 16 and 17 year olds to make their own decisions about abortion care and allowing remote hearings for those under 16 years old, eliminating the need for young people to travel to a courthouse;

* Enabling families to obtain care later in pregnancy in cases of lethal fetal diagnosis without having to travel across the country, including repealing criminal penalties for abortion care later in pregnancy; and

* Expanding the scope of practice of advanced practice clinicians, including nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and physician assistants, to allow them to provide abortion care consistent with their training.

*Thank you to everyone who called your legislators, lobbied at the State House, wrote postcards, made phone calls, signed petitions and asked friends to do the same.*
