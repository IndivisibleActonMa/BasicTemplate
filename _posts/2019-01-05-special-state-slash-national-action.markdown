* The first piece of legislation the new Democratic House majority will introduce is a sweeping democracy reform bill, known currently as HR1. The bill has four important elements for saving our democracy: expanding voter registration, implementing fair redistricting, outlawing voter purging, and restoring the Voting Rights Act. Let's read more about the key elements of the bill as compiled by the [League of Women Voters](https://www.lwv.org/blog/4-key-elements-hr1?link_id=21&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e) and then contact our representatives to let them know that we support HR1 and want them to support it as well.

* Due to the partial government shutdown, the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, ([H.R. 6545](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6545/?link_id=22&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e)), has [expired](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/24/679838115/violence-against-women-act-expires-because-of-government-shutdown). Let's contact our MoC and tell them that allowing this act to expire months after the reauthorization bill was introduced is a complete failure and that we want this legislation to be made a priority.

* Call you Members of Congress and ask them to oppose [the REINS Act](https://citizenvox.org/2017/01/03/reins-act-oppose/) ([S21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/21) in Senate, [HR26](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/26) in House). The REINS act would prevent agencies like the EPA, NTSB, FCC, etc. from enacting any regulation (even those affecting health and enviromental issues) defined as impacting the economy.
