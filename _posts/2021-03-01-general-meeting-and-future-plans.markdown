### Democracy!!!

This month our focus is on democracy.

Please join us for our monthly ***Indivisible Action Forum***!

* HR1/S1 For The People Act- We must pass this by May or republicans will gerrymander the districts for the next decade.

* Special Guest Speakers Jon Hecht and Act On Mass - Introducing the People's House Campaign

And of course, we will touch base on the latest issues calling for attention!
