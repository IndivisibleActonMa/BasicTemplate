### Climate Change

This month our focus is on climate change and energy sources.

* Acton declared a Climate Emergency in September 2020. 
A natural follow up to addressing the Climate Emergency is to find ways to have new construction no longer use on-site fossil fuels. Come hear about the new campaign *Building with Clean Energy: For a Better Future Starting Now* from Jim Snyder-Grant, [Acton Climate Coalition](https://www.actonclimatecoalition.org){:target="_blank"}.   

* What's the story with biomass?  What's going on in Springfield? We will get the low down from Laura Haight, U.S. policy director at the [Partnership for Policy Integrity](https://www.pfpi.net/){:target="_blank"}.  

Here are some good references on biomass in Massachusetts:
