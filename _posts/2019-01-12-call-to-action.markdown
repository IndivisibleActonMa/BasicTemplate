### Call to Action #1

**Stop the Trump Shutdown** by sharing stories from family, friends and neighbors about their hardships during the government shutdown. Use the hashtag #shutdownstories. Don't use twitter?  Post on our Facebook group and it will be tweeted out.  In either case, also email Monica at monica@indivisibleacton.org your stories of how you or your family is affected by the shutdown as she will be sending them directly to the Chief of Staff for Nancy Pelosi!   Lori Trahan and Nancy Pelosi have asked us to do this to put pressure on McConnell, Republican Senators, and the administration.

### Call to Action #2

**Contact Lori Trahan's office** to let her know how you feel about funding the border wall. To understand more her thoughts on the issue, read this [Boston Herald article](https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/01/07/chabot-lori-trahan-open-to-border-wall-talks/) which includes an interview with Trahan.  Email Trahan's local office at *meaghan.gallagher2@mail.house.gov* with your opinion.


### Call to Action #3

Write to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and **express your outrage over the current treatment of migrant children**. Explain how the US has a moral responsibility to protect all children and treat them with decency, regardless of immigration status and how the practice of separating children from parents is inhumane. State how [concealing data about actual numbers](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/17/report-trump-administration-migrants-1093242?link_id=23&can_id=9a7cc198611ac2a74f284fdda8e14f7e) is unconscionable and that as a taxpayer funding this egregious neglect of duty, you urge her to take full and immediate responsibility for righting this injustice.  Address: Secretary of Homeland Security, Washington, D.C. 20528 (H/T Americans of Conscience Checklist)
