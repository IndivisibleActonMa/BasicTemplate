### June Take Action Forum - Fighting AAPI Hate/Racism through Education

This month's forum is co-hosted by [COAR (Communities Organizing Against Racism)](https://www.coaraction.org/junejourneys){:target="_blank"}.  We will be having an interactive discussion about what we need to do to end Anti-Asian racism in our society.
