### Protect Bees From Toxic Pesticides

Under federal law, the EPA is required to review all registered pesticides every 15 years to make sure they don't cause unreasonable harm. This gives us the opportunity to show the EPA the science and urge it to respond with real protections for pollinators.

The EPA is currently accepting public input on the *decision to reapprove neonics*, and it's obligated to review and consider comments.

***The comment period has been extended to*** **May 4**.  

Please consider submitting your [COMMENTS HERE](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0844-1608){:target="_blank"}.

You can also sign on to [Environment Massachusetts request to ban the worst uses of neonics](https://environmentmassachusetts.webaction.org/p/dia/action4/common/public/?action_KEY=37643){:target="_blank"}.
