Now that elections are over, MA legislators (hopefully) will look at passing the ROEAct.  

The time is **NOW**: Abortion care has always been accessible for the wealthy. It’s hasn’t been for minors, for trans and nonbinary people, for Black and Brown people or for the poor.  
  
The ROE Act builds safeguards for young people seeking abortion, ensures that a person facing a fetal diagnosis later in pregnancy can access care without leaving the state, and guarantees all people in Massachusetts are able to access safe and legal abortion care without delays or barriers.
Email your MA State Representative and Senator (best to email since no one is at the State House).
