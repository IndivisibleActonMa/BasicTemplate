<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.5em;">Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble. Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.</span>

***Join the 20x20 for 2020 Club***

**The idea is simple:** log into the DemDialer for at least 20 minutes, for 20 days! You can connect with the dialer anytime from 10am to 11:30pm ET Monday through Saturday, noon to 11:30 pm on Sunday. Twenty minutes!

**Do what works for you!** It's like exercise! Some people do best with a structured time where you gather with others. For some the twenty minutes a day is the best approach! You can do both!

**How to connect to the DemDialer**

Here's a simple link that will connect you to what you need: [https://joebiden.com/call/](https://joebiden.com/call/){:target="_blank"}
