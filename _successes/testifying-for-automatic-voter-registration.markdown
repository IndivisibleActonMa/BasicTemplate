Member Monica Burke testified at the State House for a bill that is in the MA Legislature called Automatic Voter Registration.  gathered written testimony from 151 people across 39 towns in MA and in 28 groups. Went great! About 100-200 people testified in support of AVR. No one was against it (though I left early as soon as I was done).
