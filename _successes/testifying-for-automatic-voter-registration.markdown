Member Monica Burke testified at the State House for a bill that is in the MA Legislature called Automatic Voter Registration. She had gathered written testimony from 151 people across 39 towns in MA and in 28 groups, many of them from Indivisible groups either handsigned or emailed.  It Went great! About 100-200 people testified in support of AVR. No one was against it..

Automatic Voter Registration is the answer against Voter Suppression. Indivisible Acton is working with the state wide organization [Lift Every Vote](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lifteveryvote) to promote this legislation.
