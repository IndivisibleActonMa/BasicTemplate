We have sent hundreds of postcards to benefit local and remote elections. We regularly have ten to fifteen people at our post card events. We helped progressive Karen Cirillo gain a seat on the Lowell City Council. We are helping Doug Jones get elected to US Senate for Alabama. What a heist that will be!!!
