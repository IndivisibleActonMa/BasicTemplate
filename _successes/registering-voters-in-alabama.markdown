With texting using [Open Progress](https://wevolunteer.openprogress.com/Opportunities/Details/?sId=2053968) we have helped voters get reregistered in Alabama. We helped out-of-state Medical students get registered by pointing them to the forms to print and fill out. We helped registered voters determine that they had been declared "inactive" and showed them how with a few clicks they could be turned back to active.

Is it enough to overcome the wave of barriers to voting in Alabama? We shall see!
